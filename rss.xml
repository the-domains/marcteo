            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About Me</h1><p>Hi there! I am Marc, a recent graduate of the Nanyang Business School from Singapore. While I took Banking & Finance as my major and Human Resources as a double specialisation, I am going to be a Business Development management associate in the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) for Singapore, an organisation that helps to facilitate and drive the startup scene in Singapore. I will be using this blog to share my thoughts about various topics such as the current business world which can range from startups to huge MNCs, investing, productivity and personal development.Â </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/975d2936-d175-4cca-9c99-230416f2b534.jpg"></article>]]></description>
