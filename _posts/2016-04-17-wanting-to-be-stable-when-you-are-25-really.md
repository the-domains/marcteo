Of course, choosing a company that provides you with the most amount of money, time, and recognition is important. However, so many young graduates out there are taking the short term view on their perceived road to success.

It's only when you are young that you can afford to eat and live simply, for the promise of a higher purpose in the future.

It's only when you are young that you do not have as many commitments, and therefore have more time to explore what you really want to do.

Wanting to be stable, simple, and rich when you are 25? Unless you have been working towards for it all your life, it's something that does not come really easy.

It's only when you are young, do you have the capability and ability to explore, learn, take risks, be unstable, and still bounce back stronger than ever.

Of course, there are many out there that need to take short term decisions because of their contextual realities. No problem with that.

But it's the hundreds or even thousands out there, that would do much better if they understand that if you want to achieve a good quality of life and presumably, happiness, looking for stability right after you graduate might not be the best decision.

Just a 24-year old's opinion.
