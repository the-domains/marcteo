# The First Step

Some people just want to make it big in the world, to earn as much as possible, to be promoted as high as possible, to retire as fast as possible.

But, many need to realise that they simply aren't doing enough.

Just learning the theories in school isn't enough. Completing one internship isn't enough. Working at a full-time job alone may not be enough.

People need to realise that **constant****education is the key to success. **

Sometimes, it doesn't even have to cost money. Subscribing to an industry thought leader, watching an educational Youtube video, borrowing a book from the library.

And that's just the first step.
